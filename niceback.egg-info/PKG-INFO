Description: # Nicer error messages for Python
        
        Other languages such as C++ have gotten quite useful error messages and
        diagnostics with tips on how the fix the problems but Python is still stuck
        with the bare stacktraces that are very intimidating and often not very helpful.
        
        Even for the experienced programmer, it is tedious to read through the wall of
        text to find the relevant details of what went wrong. Although IPython and
        Google Colab developers have done their tweaks to improve backtraces, it is all
        too apparent that much remains to be done:

        Niceback hides the irrelevant IPython/notebook internals and concisely shows
        what happened (the program was interrupted) and where that happened. This could
        further be improved by converting the KeyboardInterrupt message into something
        more suitable, like "You stopped the program", but what you see above is just
        the default handling that never considered this particular error.
        
        ## Usage
        
        At the beginning of your Notebook:
        
        ```ipython
        !pip install git+https://github.com/Tronic/niceback.git
        import niceback
        ```
        
        ## Background
        
        This project is a proof of concept, showing a modern way to format error
        messages in a human-readable manner. Heuristics are used to hide (by default)
        irrelevant stack frames and show the actual location of the problem. Since it
        would otherwise be impossible to find out the variable contents after the program
        has crashed, a variable inspector built into each stack frame quickly reveals
        problems with the variables mentioned at the source of error. Care is taken to
        add revelant details such as notebook input field numbers and class names not
        normally present in Python tracebacks, while hiding overly long paths and other
        clutter.
        
        All output is in HTML and as such only works in Jupyter notebooks and other
        browser-based systems (this should be useful for web development frameworks as
        well). This allows interactivity and much better layout than that of the text
        console.
        
        ## Help wanted
        
        I won't be able to maintain this all by myself. If you like the idea of nicer
        tracebacks, please offer your help in development! Pull requests are welcome
        but it would be even better if you could pick up the whole project as your own.
        
        As of now, this project is in no way properly polished for release. Yet, it is
        useful enough to such a degree that I always use it in my notebooks, and it
        really makes Python development a much smoother experience.
